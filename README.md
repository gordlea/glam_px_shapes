This is just a set of shapes based on [glam](https://github.com/bitshifter/glam-rs) that I seemed to keep reinventing everytime I started a new game project.

They are useful for working with pixel buffer style stuff where you want to iterate over each pixel in a shape.

This is mostly undocumented, once things stabilize i may make it fit for public consumption.
